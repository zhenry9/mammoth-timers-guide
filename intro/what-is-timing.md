# What is Ski Race Timing?
Timing a ski race, most simply, is calculating the time between the moment a racer breaks the start wand and the moment they cross the finish line. It is calculated to the 1/100th of a second, and is used to rank competitors in a race and determine a winner. Without timing, there can't be a race.
To time a fair race, equipment and procedures must be consistent for all racers. Best practices must be used to ensure that the race operates in a fair and timely manner.

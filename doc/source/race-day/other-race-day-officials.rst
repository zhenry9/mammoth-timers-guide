A note on volunteers
--------------------
Many essential positions, especially gatekeepers and handtimers, are staffed by volunteer workers. These can be tough jobs, especially in bad weather, which occurs often at Mammoth. Volunteer staff should be treated with patience, kindness and gratitude at all times. They are working for free and we rely on them to have a successful event.

Starter
-------
*Relevant ICR sections:* :term:`612.1`, :term:`613.4`, :term:`613.7`

The starter has two main jobs:
	- **Keep the timer informed of who is in the gate**
	- **Give the start cadence to competitors**
	
The starter is in communication with the timer in the finish shack at all times using a :ref:`headset`. The starter acts as the timer's eyes and ears in the start area. It is crucial that the timer knows clearly which competitors are on course or getting ready to start. As a competitor enters the start gate, the starter reads his or her bib number to the timer. When the competitor starts, the starter reiterates the starting competitor's bib number and reads the bib number of the next competitor in the gate. 

In practice, this sounds like:
	"Bib 12 on course, bib 13 in the gate."
Or:
	"12 on, 13 in."

The starter is also responsible for giving the start cadence to the racer in the gate. This lets the racer know when it is their time to start. 

For fixed interval races, the cadence is described in rule :term:`613.4`. Ten seconds before a racer's assigned start, the starter gives a ten second warning. Five seconds before the assigned start time the starter counts down to one then gives the start command. The starter should then count back up to five to mark the legal start period described in rule :term:`613.7`. For example:

|"Ten seconds
|
|Five
|Four
|Three
|Two
|One
|Go
|One
|Two
|Three
|Four
|Five"
	
A start clock such as the :doc:`../equipment/alge-asc3` can be very helpful for this process, and should be used for all fixed interval races. It is important to note however that according to rule :term:`U613.4` that the start clock cannot replace the verbal cadence for US Ski and Snowboard races.

For irregular interval races (Slalom), the start cadence is described in rule :term:`805.3`. When it is safe for the racer to start, the starter says:

|	"Ready
|	Go"
	
The racer then has about ten seconds to legally start after the starter says go. The starter should coordinate with the timer and the jury to determine a safe start interval. This is normally done visually, for example when the racer on course reaches the second flush.

Handtimers
----------
*Relevant ICR sections:* :term:`611.2.2`, :term:`612.5`

Handtimers operate the manual (System C) backup timing system. They are stationed at the start and the finish of the course and use a :doc:`../equipment/hand-watch` to take and record start and finish times of day. Hand times are used in the :doc:`TDTR` to verify electronic timing system accuracy, and in the event of a failure of both electronic timing systems hand times are used to calculate race times. In an ideal world hand times are not used to calculate results, but it can and does happen. It is therefore an absolutely essential position and care should be taken that the hand watches are setup correctly and the hand timing staff are properly trained.

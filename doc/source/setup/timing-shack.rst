Timing Shack Setup
==================

.. figure:: ../img/timing-shack-signal-flow.png

	Basic timing shack signal flow for homologated races.
	
The timing shack is where the timing system is tied together. The start and the finish are connected to the electronic timers, and the electronic timers to the timing PC(s). Communications are established between the timer and the starter, and between the scoreboard staff. Accessories such as digital display boards are setup.

Impulse distributors are not required by rule, and some mountains don't use them. However, the large amount of electrical noise at Mammoth Mountain necessitates their use here. They filter the noise out of timing lines and prevent false impulses.

Connecting the electronic timers

The first step is to connect the start and finish to the electronic timers. This is made easier by the labled timing boards located in each of the timing shacks. For this example we will use the timing board in the :ref:`Hilton`.

Connect the start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|start2| Connect 'Time 1' on the timing board to 'Input 1' on the start impulse distributor. This is the System A start.

|start3| Connect 'Time 2' on the timing board to 'Input 2' on the distributor. This is the System B start.

|start4| Connect 'Output 1' on the distributor to 'Input 1' on the System A electronic timer.

|start5| Connect 'Output 2' on the distributor to 'Input 1' on the System B electronic timer.

Connect the finish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|start2| Connect 'HiFi 1' on the timing board to 'Input 1' on the finish impulse distributor. This is the System A finish.

|start3| Connect 'HiFi 2' on the timing board to 'Input 2' on the distributor. This is the System B finish.

|start4| Connect 'Output 1' on the distributor to 'Input 2' on the System A electronic timer.

|start5| Connect 'Output 2' on the distributor to 'Input 2' on the System B electronic timer.

General Best Practices
----------------------


Make a Plan and Prepare Before Race Day
---------------------------------------
The first and most important step to success is to have a plan beforehand. You should be well familiar with the race day schedule long before you get there, and address any issues beforehand. You should know what equipment and staff you will need. 

The morning of a race can be chaotic. Plans and schedules can change suddenly due to weather, snow conditions or lift status, so you should do as much as you possibly can before race day. The more pieces of your timing plan that are already in place the less stress you will feel to get the race started on time. Before race day the hill wiring should be tested and retested, the batteries in all timing equipment checked, and all equipment and connections made inside the timing shack. Start and finish equipment should be assembled into :ref:`kits <Equipment Kits>` and be ready to go out on hill on the first lift ride of the morning.

Always Have a Backup
--------------------
Equipment can and will break, usually at the worst possible time. There should be a backup for every piece of equipment used on race day, ready and in a good location to be quickly swapped out. Timing staff should always carry tape, spare batteries, a screwdriver and a knife. Stopping a race to get a new nine volt from the Hilton is not an acceptable delay.

Secure All Connections
----------------------
Race timing involves lots of wiring connections, usually in outdoor or high traffic areas. Connections should be made with the extreme wind and moisture possible at Mammoth Mountain in mind. This means taping all banana plug connections to avoid shorts or accidental disconnections, and keeping wires secured to fences, trees, bamboo etc. along the way. In open areas, wires should also be ran safely away from any possible skier or foot traffic. This means either trenched under the snow or flown high overhead.

Expect the Unexpected
---------------------
Almost every race series will involve at least one unplanned catastrophe. Following the above best practices will help you anticipate these events and put you in the best possible position to respond.

Keep it TIGHT
-------------
There should be no wiggle, play or slop in any piece of timing equipment you install. If something has room to move it will, and it will cause you problems later. If you are attaching a start block to a start post, make it **tight** until the teeth on the block bight into the wood. It should last for eight hours and hundreds of starts without moving at all. If you are drilling a hole for a finish post, use an appropriately sized bit and avoid the urge to ream the hole out. Use a rubber mallet to pound it in. The post should be **tight** in the snow, the gimble should be **tight** to the post, and the photocell should be **tight** to the gimble. Your aim should be **tight** to the other photecell and gimble setting screwed down **tight**. It may be freezing cold in the morning, but during the course of the day the sun will be higher in the sky and the air temperature may increase by twenty degrees or more. Things will loosen on their own, so start as tight as possible. These are just a few examples, but the concept should be applied to everything you do. It is much easier to spend the extra time to set something up correctly than it is to fix it during a race.

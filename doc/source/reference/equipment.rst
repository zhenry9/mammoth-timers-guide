  **SYNCING TIME OF DAY**
  
  1.	When ready for sync, turn clock on.

  2.	Top of clock says ‘store’. Hit Green #1 button on remote until bottom of clock says “no”. Hit Yellow #2 button to continue.

  3.	Top of clock says ‘scan’. Hit Yellow #2 button to continue.

  4.	Set time of day according to instructions from timekeeper. Use Green #1 button to increase digit, use Yellow #2 button to advance to next digit. 

  5.	When correct time is displayed wait until ‘sync’ flashes on bottom of clock.

  6.	Open start wand on signal from timekeeper to sync start clock.

  7.	Clock says ‘ProGrA’ at top. Use Green #1 button to make sure bottom of clock says ‘01’. Hit Yellow #2 button to continue.
  
  **SETTING INTERVAL AND BRIGHTNESS**

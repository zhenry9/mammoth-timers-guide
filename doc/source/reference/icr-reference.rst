611.1 Communications & Cabling
In all international competitions, it is highly recommended that there is
multiple communications (telephone or radios, etc.) between the Start and
Finish. Voice communication between Start and Finish must be assured
by fixed wire connection or radio. In case of radio, this must be on a
separate channel from that used by any other function of the OC.
In Olympic Winter Games and FIS World Championships all
communications and timing connections between Start and Finish must be
assured by fixed wiring.
611.2 Timing Equipment
For all events in the FIS Calendar, electronic timers, start gates and
photocells homologated by the FIS must be used. A list of these approved
devices will be published. Races using timing equipment other than those
on the homologated FIS list will not be considered for FIS points.
Specifications and procedures for timing are more fully described in a
separate FIS Timing Booklet.
611.2.1 Electric Timing
For all international competitions, FIS World Cup, FIS Continental Cups
and FIS competitions, two synchronised electronically isolated timing
systems operating in time-of-day must be used. One system will be
designated system A (main system), the other system B (back-up system)
prior to the beginning of the race. Only exception for Parallel competitions,
on Level 2, 3 and 4 where no system B is required.
Time of day times must be immediately and automatically sequentially
recorded on printed strips at the maximum precision of the timing device
according to the requirements for homologation. The final result is
calculated by subtracting the start time from the finish time for each skier’s
run and is then expressed to 1/100th (0.01) precision by truncating the
calculated net time on course.
All times used for the final result must be from system A. If there is a
failure of system A, a calculated net time from system B must be used
following the same procedure as set out in art. 611.3.2.1. It is not
permitted to substitute time-of-day times from system B for use with
system A for the purpose of net time calculations.
For all events, system A must be connected to its respective start gate
contact. System B must be separately connected to another electronically
isolated start gate contact.
Refer to the FIS Timing Booklet for more details regarding cabling and
complete wiring descriptions, diagrams and start gate installations.
All timing equipment and technical installation should be set up or
protected in such a way that danger to the competitors is avoided where
possible.
Synchronisation of the timing systems must occur as close as possible to
the scheduled start for the first run of the day. Synchronisation of all 
53
systems must be maintained throughout each run. Timers must not be resynchronised during any run.
611.2.1.1 Start Gate
The start gate must have separate electronically isolated switch contacts
for triggering the start inputs of both system A & B.
If a start gate or start wand requires replacement during a run, it must be
replaced with identical equipment in the same position
611.2.1.2 Photocells
For all events, there must be two photocell system(s) homologated by the
FIS installed at the finish line. One is connected to system A. The other is
connected to system B.
Procedures and regulations for start gates and photocells are found in the
FIS Timing Booklet.
611.2.1.3 Start Clock
For DH, SG and GS, the use of a start clock that provides at least an
acoustic countdown signal on the fixed start interval as prescribed by the
Jury should be used as an aid to race management. This is mandatory for
all Level 0,1 and 2 races.
611.2.2 Hand Timing
Manual (hand) timing, completely separate and independent of the
electronic timing, must be used for all competitions listed in the FIS
Calendar. Stopwatches or hand operated battery powered timers that are
installed at both the Start and the Finish and capable of expressing the
time of day to at least 1/100th (0.01) precision qualify as proper hand
timing devices. They must be synchronised prior to the start of the first
run, with the same time-of-day as system A and system B (see art.
611.2.1). Printed records, either automatic or hand-written, of recorded
hand times must be immediately available at the start and at the finish.
611.2.3 Presentation of times
Organisers should provide appropriate facilities for continuous
presentation of all registered times of all competitors.
611.2.4 Timing without Cable
For FIS Level 3 events only, it is permitted to use homologated timing
equipment in such a way that hill cable connection between start and
finish is not required. Refer to the FIS Timing Booklet for a detailed
discussion of how this is possible.
611.3 Timing
611.3.1 With electronic timing, the time is taken when a competitor crosses the
finish line and triggers the beam between the photo cells.
In case of a fall at the finish where the competitor does not come to a full
stop, the time can be taken without both of the competitor’s feet having
crossed the finish line.
For the registered time to become valid, the competitor must immediately
completely cross the finish line with or without skis. With hand timing the
time will be taken when any part of the competitor crosses the finish line.
54
The finish controller determines the correctness of passage across the
finish line.
611.3.2 In the case of a failure of the main electronic timing system (system A),
the results of the electronic back-up system (system B) will be valid as per
art. 611.2.1. For the Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski
Championships and FIS World Cup, a synchronised electronic timing
system with printers, connected to the starting gate and to the photocells
at the finish is obligatory.
In case of a failure in the lines of the timing system between start and
finish, this back-up system will allow the calculation of the times to
1/100ths of a second.
In the case that time of day from either system A or system B are not
available for a competitor, the calculated time of day as per art. 611.3.2.1
will be considered valid.
611.3.2.1 Utilisation of times taken by hand
Hand times may be used in the official results after a correction has been
calculated.
Calculation of the correction:
Subtract the electronic time from the time taken by hand for the 10
competitors starting before the missing time. If there are not 10 times
before, complete the calculation with the remaining times after the missed
time.
The sum of the 10 time differences is divided by 10 and rounded up or
down (0.044 -> 0.04, 0.045 -> 0.05) to give the correction which must be
applied to the hand time of the competitor without an electronic time.
611.3.2.2 Photo Finish
A Photo Finish System may be used to determine a competitor´s finish
time. In case of a failure of system “A” and “B”, and where the competition
has been recorded by the Photo Finish System, this time must be used in
place of hand-timing without any correction.
The photo finish time is taken when any part of the competitor´s body first
crosses the Finish line. The photo finish result is to be provided to the Jury
only.
611.3.3 The official timing strips from the printer will be given to the Technical
Delegate for review. They will be kept by the OC until the official approval
of the race or after any appeal dealing with timing or race results.
A technical timing report form as prescribed by the FIS must accompany
the race results and must be reviewed and sent by the chief of timing and
reviewed and confirmed by the TD as approval of the race.
All printed records from system A, system B and hand timing must be
retained by the OC for a period of three (3) months after the competition
or after any appeal dealing with timing or race results.
611.3.4 When the official printing timer allows manual input or correction of a time,
some type of indication (star, asterisk or other) concerning any effected
change must be printed on all timing documentation.
611.3.5 Computer software calculating net times must use the precision of the
time of the day as used in the timing device.
55
611.4 Private timing and speed measurement equipment of the Teams
Any request to install such equipment has to be made to the Jury by the
team captain concerned, and the Jury decides concerning approval of the
installation. At Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships and
FIS World Cup only the organisers timing equipment is permitted.
